# Integration with KIND

Integration with KIND is achieved by

- not using any specific version of Ambassador (so it will always install the latest one).
- not specifying an update window.
- installing the OSS version of Ambassador.

## Testing

First install the CRDs with

```commandline
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/datawire/ambassador-operator/releases/latest/download/ambassador-operator-crds.yaml
```

Now install the kind-specific manifest for installing Ambassador OSS with the
operator in the `ambassador` namespace:

```commandline
kubectl apply -n ambassador -f https://github.com/datawire/ambassador-operator/releases/latest/download/ambassador-operator-kind.yaml
```

You can load the following example application and `Ingress`:

```commandline
$ cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: foo-app
  labels:
    app: foo
spec:
  containers:
  - name: foo-app
    image: hashicorp/http-echo
    args:
    - "-text=foo"
---
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: foo-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: foo
  ports:
  # Default port used by the image
  - port: 5678
---
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: bar-app
  labels:
    app: bar
spec:
  containers:
  - name: bar-app
    image: hashicorp/http-echo
    args:
    - "-text=bar"
---
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: bar-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: bar
  ports:
  # Default port used by the image
  - port: 5678
---
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: example-ingress
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: ambassador
spec:
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /foo
        backend:
          serviceName: foo-service
          servicePort: 5678
      - path: /bar
        backend:
          serviceName: bar-service
          servicePort: 5678
```

Now verify that the ingress works

```commandline
$ curl localhost/bar
bar
$ curl localhost/foo
foo
```
